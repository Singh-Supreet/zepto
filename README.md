# Zepto Assignment 

Followed the task instructions to create the component and hosted it on GitHub Pages.

Successfully implemented the specified requirements:

Upon clicking the input field, a list of items is displayed.
While typing, the list dynamically shows matching items.
Clicking on an item transforms it into a chip at the top, with the input field adjusting accordingly.
Once an item becomes a chip, it is removed from the list.
Each chip includes an "X" icon, enabling removal, and reinstating the item to the list.
Completed the bonus tasks:

Ensured code cleanliness (though there's potential for improvement given time constraints).
Implemented TypeScript.
Addressed a specific scenario: when the input is empty, pressing backspace highlights and subsequently deletes the last chip (e.g., Nick Giannopoulos) with successive backspace presses.
